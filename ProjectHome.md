This project is designed to be a flexible, open source project that lets a user track the following things:

A group of items (configurable)
> Start of shelf life (configurable)
> End of shelf life (configurable)

This application is intended to serve a large set of users.

The inspiration for this program was the Jtrac program: http://jtrac.info/

As of March 2008, this project is held in abeyance.
